Telehealth during COVID-19: How to Increase Security while Maximizing Efficiency,07/02/2020,"As COVID-19 cases continued to rise worldwide, technology followed suit with many industries, including healthcare, amplifying their usage. Frontline heroes turned to telehealth technology with increased frequency compared to years prior as more than 46% of patient services were offered virtually. Although treating patients remotely is not new, (the earliest record shows telehealth in use in the late 1950s and early 1960s) privacy and security regulations have evolved to help safeguard patients seeking care. Since doctors and patients are continuing to maintain physical distance and leveraging communications to bridge this gap, it is more important than ever to confirm that the right patients are being reached.",https://iconectiv.com/news-events/telehealth-during-covid-19-how-increase-security-while-maximizing-efficiency,Read Full Article,

The Genius is Within: Real Innovation Begins by Listening to the Right Voices,04/22/2020,"I recently came across a 1984 article written about Mervin J. Kelly, the legendary American physicist whose career with Bell Labs spanned 23 years and multiple positions, from Director of Research to Chairman of the Board and everything in between. Described as a motivator who asked the right questions and found the best people to answer them, he is hailed as the driving force that steered the famed research enterprise into solid-state physics, a novel field of study that resulted in the 1948 invention of the transistor and the semiconductor chip.

The building block for all digital communications, from home computers to space shuttles, its inventors, Bell Lab physicists William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain, won the Nobel Prize in 1956. Upon Kelly’s retirement in 1959, he, too, won a top prize, the John Fritz Medal, the highest honor reserved for engineering greats such as Alexander Graham Bell, Alfred Nobel, Charles Kettering, George Westinghouse and Orville Wright.",https://iconectiv.com/news-events/genius-within-real-innovation-begins-listening-right-voices,Read Full Article,
Black Swan Solution Guide: Getting Porting History and Carrier Data to Verify Identity and Mitigate Account Takeovers,03/06/2020,"Not all risk intelligence sources are of equal value.  Some are so important that ignoring them might prove disastrous. One intelligence source of increasing importance is getting real-time notice of changes to telephone number ports and the carrier-of-record.  There are good reasons why this intelligence is so vital.

Indeed, checking on the security and stability of the smartphone account is now considered critical by enterprises and identity aggregators in banking, e-commerce, insurance, healthcare and many other industries. For instance, when a customer wants to do a large banking transaction using a smartphone, it would benefit the financial institution to know that the phone number was just ported a few minutes ago: that could indicate an increased risk and alert the bank that further identity checks are advisable.",http://bswan.org/portdata_validate_guide.asp,Read Full Article,
