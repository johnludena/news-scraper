Kelly, the legendary American physicist whose career with Bell Labs spanned 23 years and multiple positions, from Director of Research to Chairman of the Board and everything in between.

The building block for all digital communications, from home computers to space shuttles, its inventors, Bell Lab physicists William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain, won the Nobel Prize in 1956.

Telcordia has extensive experience in numbering administration in the U.S. and abroad. The North American Numbering Council (NANC) – a Federal Advisory Committee created to advise the Commission on numbering issues – and the Commission staff evaluated the bids for technical and managerial competence, security considerations, and cost-effectiveness.

While we have been planning for the transition for some time, we are glad to officially move the transition process forward,” said Richard Jacowleff, President and CEO of iconectiv. “We appreciate the tremendous work of the North American Portability Management, the Transition Oversight Manager, the North American Numbering Council, and many leading voices from across the telecommunications industry who have actively participated in this process. In particular, I would like to thank the Chairman and Commissioners of the FCC and their dedicated and hardworking staff for all the work they have done to bring the selection and contracting process to a close.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>“This new NPAC system will include best-in-class technology and security while providing number portability at a fraction of the current cost,” Jacowleff added.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The new modern, cost-efficient and secure NPAC will have the same functionality as the current system and will be completely compatible with existing gateway systems. iconectiv already has a dedicated team in place to implement a smooth transition. In the coming weeks more information will be shared about the transition process with all NPAC users, including all service providers, law enforcement, and public safety organizations.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The North American Numbering Council (NANC) and the North American Portability Management (NAPM) recommended to the FCC that iconectiv be selected as the new LNPA after a long and thorough process conducted by the NANC, and the NAPM, and overseen by the FCC. This process included extensive commentary and engagement with the public, the telecommunications industry, and state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies. The FCC adopted an order in March 2015 instructing the NAPM to initiate contract negotiations with iconectiv to serve as the new LNPA, subject to the FCC’s final review of the contract. With the FCC’s final approval, the parties can now move forward to final execution of the contract.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A leader in number portability solutions, iconectiv has successfully deployed numbering solutions in 21 countries around the globe and has been a long standing part of the U.S. telecommunications landscape, including the number portability ecosystem since its inception. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Following the transition to the new NPAC, iconectiv will manage the Number Portability Administration Center/Service Management System (NPAC/SMS). The NPAC/SMS is the central platform that supports the secure and efficient porting of telephone numbers to allow customers to keep their telephone numbers when switching communications service providers. Thousands of wireline, wireless, VoIP and cable service providers, and hundreds of law enforcement agencies and 911 public safety answering authorities in the U.S. depend on this central, common and authoritative database for numbering services. In addition, hundreds of businesses that engage in telemarketing rely on the number porting data to remain in compliance with federal regulations.&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>About iconectiv&nbsp;</b><br></p><p>At iconectiv, we envision a world without boundaries, where the ability to access and exchange information is simple, secure and seamless.

FCC Conditionally Approves Telcordia as Next LNPA...,05/25/2016,"Washington, D.C. – The Federal Communications Commission today conditionally approved a recommendation that Telcordia Technologies Inc. serve as the next administrator of the service that allows consumers and businesses to keep their phone numbers when switching carriers, called “local number portability.”",,,"<p><b>Washington, D.C</b>. – The Federal Communications Commission today conditionally approved a recommendation that Telcordia Technologies Inc. serve as the next administrator of the service that allows consumers and businesses to keep their phone numbers when switching carriers, called “local number portability.”&nbsp;</p><p>Local number portability fuels competition by allowing consumers and businesses to choose their phone provider based on cost and service, without the inconvenience and expense of losing a familiar number. In addition to the porting of over 100,000 numbers a day, the capabilities built around local number portability are critical to public safety, law enforcement and consumer protection.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The recommendation of Telcordia as Local Number Portability Administrator (LNPA) was developed following a multiyear, competitive process implemented by the FCC’s federal advisory committee on numbering, the North American Numbering Council, with oversight from the FCC. This process included extensive input from industry, consumers, and public safety and government entities, resulting in the recommendation of an experienced, qualified company to administer and keep the system secure.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Neustar, Inc. and its predecessors have administered number porting since 1997, starting with a five-year contract that was extended three times. The FCC’s Wireline Competition Bureau in 2011 issued an Order detailing a process to award the LNPA contract through a competitive process. The process was supported by Neustar, Telcordia, and others, and included evaluation of technical and managerial competence, security and reliability, public safety and law enforcement considerations, cost-effectiveness and neutrality. The process required bidders to respond to questions about service quality and system security and reliability. It also required bidders to describe how they would ensure a smooth and secure transition, including by providing opportunities to test any proposed system.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Order today does not award a contract. Rather, it authorizes contract negotiations between the NAPM (North American Portability Management, LLC), which is an industry consortium, and Telcordia. The negotiated contract will be subject to Commission review to ensure that the neutrality and security requirements are fully satisfied.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Action by the Commission March 26, 2015, by Order (FCC 15-35).

What you need to know about the NPAC Transition,02/09/2018,"The Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC) is the system used to facilitate number porting in the U.S. for wireline, wireless, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) providers. ",,,"

<p><strong>What is the NPAC and why is it valuable?</strong><br>
<br>
The Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC) is the system used to
facilitate number porting in the U.S. for wireline, wireless, and Voice over
Internet Protocol (VoIP) providers. The system supports the implementation of
Local Number Portability and provides users with access to the most current and
accurate data for ported telephone numbers, including porting information and
the service provider’s law enforcement contact’s reach information.</p>

<p><strong>How is the service accessed?</strong><br>
<br>
Law enforcement agencies and Public Safety Answering Points (PSAP) rely on two
NPAC services for this information. The Interactive Voice Response (IVR) is a&nbsp;<strong>free</strong>&nbsp;telephone-based service and the
Enhanced Law Enforcement Platform (ELEP) is a&nbsp;<strong>subscription</strong>-based
online option. Law enforcement and public safety agencies can&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://lawenforcement.numberportability.com/registration/"">register today</a></strong>.</p>"
