The building block for all digital communications, from home computers to space shuttles, its inventors, Bell Lab physicists William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain, won the Nobel Prize in 1956.

Black Swan Solution Guide: Getting Porting History and Carrier Data to Verify Identity and Mitigate Account Takeovers,03/06/2020,"Not all risk intelligence sources are of equal value.  Some are so important that ignoring them might prove disastrous. One intelligence source of increasing importance is getting real-time notice of changes to telephone number ports and the carrier-of-record.  There are good reasons why this intelligence is so vital.

Indeed, checking on the security and stability of the smartphone account is now considered critical by enterprises and identity aggregators in banking, e-commerce, insurance, healthcare and many other industries. For instance, when a customer wants to do a large banking transaction using a smartphone, it would benefit the financial institution to know that the phone number was just ported a few minutes ago: that could indicate an increased risk and alert the bank that further identity checks are advisable.",http://bswan.org/portdata_validate_guide.asp,Read Full Article,

Quickly Access the Critical Information You Need to Accelerate Criminal Investigations,04/18/2019,"Those in law enforcement know that ensuring data accuracy and working quickly to solve investigations in a timely manner is critical. It can be frustrating when delays in seemingly simple tasks, like accessing phone records, hold up the process due to missing or inaccurate information.",,,"<p></p><p>April 18, 2019: Those in law enforcement know that ensuring data
accuracy and working quickly to solve investigations in a timely manner is
critical. It can be frustrating when delays in seemingly simple tasks, like
accessing phone records, hold up the process due to missing or inaccurate
information. </p>

<p>Investigators need to request phone records from a service
provider, wait to receive it and then determine if the record aligns with the
investigation, all of which takes time and resources to track. Often it is not
until the records are back that an investigator discovers they sent it to the
incorrect service provider and/or it does not cover the entire historical period
they are looking into. </p>

<p>The nation’s Number Portability Administration Center
(NPAC), managed by iconectiv, expedites this by allowing qualified law
enforcement agencies to determine which U.S. communications service provider
owns the phone number that is of interest in a criminal investigation or
law-related matter. Given that iconectiv is the only FCC authorized company in
the United States to administer number portability, every service provider in
the country that ports numbers is mandated to register in the system and law
enforcement and public safety agencies can quickly gain the accurate information
they need with the click of a button. </p>

<p>The quickest and only way to access historical phone data is
through the Enhanced Law Enforcement Platform (ELEP). A secure,
subscription-based service, ELEP allows users to query up to 100 numbers at a
time, provides full porting history, as well as lists the current service
provider of record.&nbsp; </p>

The Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC) is the system used to
facilitate number porting in the U.S. for wireline, wireless, and Voice over
Internet Protocol (VoIP) providers. The system supports the implementation of
Local Number Portability and provides users with access to the most current and

Future NPAC Administrator iconectiv Begins Testing,11/21/2017,Ericsson’s (News - Alert) iconectiv in mid-May began industry testing related to its future role as the nation’s Local Number Portability Administrator. The testing commenced more than two years after the FCC (News - Alert) awarded the company a contract to manage the Number Portability Administration Center routing database.,,,"<p>Ericsson’s (<a href=""http://www.tmcnet.com/snapshots/snapshots.aspx?Company=Ericsson"">News</a> - <a href=""http://www.tmcnet.com/enews/subs.aspx?k1=%22Ericsson%22"">Alert</a>) iconectiv in mid-May began industry testing related to its future role as the nation’s Local Number Portability Administrator. The testing commenced more than two years after the FCC (<a href=""http://www.tmcnet.com/snapshots/snapshots.aspx?Company=Ericsson"">News</a> - <a href=""http://www.tmcnet.com/enews/subs.aspx?k1=%22Ericsson%22"">Alert</a>) awarded the company a contract to manage the Number Portability Administration Center routing database.</p><p>But getting this right is important, given everybody from consumers to businesses, emergency response and law enforcement, and carriers rely on NPAC. Indeed, this database is considered a critical part of the infrastructure in the U.S.</p><p>That’s because the database enables subscribers to switch service providers without having to change phone numbers. It also ensures reliability and correct information related to 911 services and law enforcement investigations.</p><p>Neustar has been managing the NPAC for about two decades, and reportedly made more than $3 billion doing that between 1997 and 2015, accounting for about half of the company’s revenues. But a few years ago the job came up for government bid, and Ericsson AB’s Telcordia (<a href=""http://www.tmcnet.com/snapshots/snapshots.aspx?Company=Ericsson"">News</a> - <a href=""http://www.tmcnet.com/enews/subs.aspx?k1=%22Ericsson%22"">Alert</a>) won the deal in March of 2015.</p><p>Telcordia now offers services under the iconectiv brand. Although this is a relatively new name, Telcordia has a long and strong history in communications.</p><p>The company got its start as Bellcore, the R&amp;D effort of the Bell companies. It later went independent and was renamed Telcordia. Then, in 2012, Ericsson bought Telcordia to capture its expertise and technology related to operational and business support systems and related technologies. And in 2013 Ericsson launched the iconectiv (<a href=""http://www.tmcnet.com/snapshots/snapshots.aspx?Company=Ericsson"">News</a> - <a href=""http://www.tmcnet.com/enews/subs.aspx?k1=%22Ericsson%22"">Alert</a>) brand for its interconnection services.</p><p>During the first phase of NPAC testing, companies that access NPAC through direct Service Order Administration or Local Service Management System will work to validate that their systems interface properly with the iconectiv NPAC. Vendors will be involved in the first part of this testing, and then service bureaus and service providers will do such testing, which is mandatory for any organization using the SOA or LSMS interfaces.</p><p>Optional testing will open up after that. That’s expected to commence in the second half of this year, after this first phase of testing is complete. The optional testing will address things like Ancillary Services, Data Migration, LTI GUI, &nbsp;and Group and Round Robin.<br>A spokeswoman for iconectiv tells <em>INTERNET TELEPHONY</em> that everything is on track to complete the transition from Neustar to iconectiv by the second quarter of 2018, with a final acceptance date in May 2018. The Neustar contract was originally set to expire in September 2016, but was extended to provide for the completion of the transition, she added. Following the transition, iconectiv will be the sole administrator for all seven of the U.S. NPAC regions.</p><p>As for Neustar, the company’s website indicates it has other products and services. It delivers marketing solutions related to customer activation and intelligence, identity data management, and marketing analytics; risk solutions, including compliance and fraud prevention solutions; security offerings, including protection against distributed denial of service of attack, DNS services, and website performance management; core registry and digital naming services; and communications capabilities, including address and routing, caller identification, order management, and number management solutions.<br></p><p><a href=""http://www.tmcnet.com/voip/departments/articles/435618-future-npac-administrator-iconectiv-begins-testing.htm"">View original article</a><br></p>"

The process was supported by Neustar, Telcordia, and others, and included evaluation of technical and managerial competence, security and reliability, public safety and law enforcement considerations, cost-effectiveness and neutrality.

In particular, I would like to thank the Chairman and Commissioners of the FCC and their dedicated and hardworking staff for all the work they have done to bring the selection and contracting process to a close.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>“This new NPAC system will include best-in-class technology and security while providing number portability at a fraction of the current cost,” Jacowleff added.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The new modern, cost-efficient and secure NPAC will have the same functionality as the current system and will be completely compatible with existing gateway systems. iconectiv already has a dedicated team in place to implement a smooth transition. In the coming weeks more information will be shared about the transition process with all NPAC users, including all service providers, law enforcement, and public safety organizations.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The North American Numbering Council (NANC) and the North American Portability Management (NAPM) recommended to the FCC that iconectiv be selected as the new LNPA after a long and thorough process conducted by the NANC, and the NAPM, and overseen by the FCC. This process included extensive commentary and engagement with the public, the telecommunications industry, and state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies. The FCC adopted an order in March 2015 instructing the NAPM to initiate contract negotiations with iconectiv to serve as the new LNPA, subject to the FCC’s final review of the contract. With the FCC’s final approval, the parties can now move forward to final execution of the contract.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A leader in number portability solutions, iconectiv has successfully deployed numbering solutions in 21 countries around the globe and has been a long standing part of the U.S. telecommunications landscape, including the number portability ecosystem since its inception. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Following the transition to the new NPAC, iconectiv will manage the Number Portability Administration Center/Service Management System (NPAC/SMS). The NPAC/SMS is the central platform that supports the secure and efficient porting of telephone numbers to allow customers to keep their telephone numbers when switching communications service providers. Thousands of wireline, wireless, VoIP and cable service providers, and hundreds of law enforcement agencies and 911 public safety answering authorities in the U.S. depend on this central, common and authoritative database for numbering services. In addition, hundreds of businesses that engage in telemarketing rely on the number porting data to remain in compliance with federal regulations.&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>About iconectiv&nbsp;</b><br></p><p>At iconectiv, we envision a world without boundaries, where the ability to access and exchange information is simple, secure and seamless.

Status Update: Local Number Portability Administrator Contract,03/04/2015,"Background: The FCC’s “local number portability” system allows consumers and businesses to keep their
phone number when switching providers, which supports consumer choice and competition in the
communications market. The transfer or “porting” of numbers between carriers is done by a neutral third
party called the Local Number Portability Administrator (LNPA). Number portability costs are paid for by
the industry. The current LNPA’s contract automatically renews for one-year terms and the next available
termination date is June 30, 2015. The FCC is overseeing the process to select the next LNPA. Maintaining
the integrity and availability of the porting system is paramount.",,,"<p><b>Background:</b>&nbsp;The FCC’s “local number portability” system allows consumers and businesses to keep their phone number when switching providers, which supports consumer choice and competition in the communications market.

Maintaining the integrity and availability of the porting system is paramount.&nbsp;</p><p><b>The Action:</b>&nbsp;Today, the Wireline Competition Bureau is circulating a draft order to the full Commission, which, if adopted, would initiate contract negotiations with Telcordia (d/b/a iconectiv) to serve as the next LNPA. Telcordia has extensive experience in numbering administration in the U.S. and abroad. The North American Numbering Council (NANC) – a Federal Advisory Committee created to advise the Commission on numbering issues – and the Commission staff evaluated the bids for technical and managerial competence, security considerations, and cost-effectiveness. The draft includes provisions to ensure a smooth transition and to protect the integrity and availability of the system during and after the transition.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Role of the LNPA:</b>&nbsp;The LNPA develops, maintains and operates the processes and database used to “port” or transfer numbers. The LNPA also provides services to law enforcement and public safety organizations.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Reason for the Action:</b>&nbsp;Neustar (or its predecessor-in-interest) has been the LNPA since 1997. Neustar provides service under a contract with an industry group, North American Portability Management LLC (NAPM:&nbsp;<a href=""http://bit.ly/17RekCN"">http://bit.ly/17RekCN</a>), which recommended using a competitive process (<a href=""http://bit.ly/1Nh05I4"">http://bit.ly/1Nh05I4</a>) to select the next LNPA.&nbsp;</p><p><b>The Process:</b>&nbsp;The process to select the next LNPA has been progressing since 2011.&nbsp;</p><p></p><ul><li>In March and May 2011, after providing notice and receiving comment, the Wireline Competition Bureau issued two orders (DA 11-454 (<a href=""http://bit.ly/1Kkcpsf"">http://bit.ly/1Kkcpsf</a>) and DA 11-883 (<a href=""http://bit.ly/1B2j4RK"">http://bit.ly/1B2j4RK</a>) setting out the selection process. &nbsp;</li><li>In February 2013, after providing notice and receiving comment (<a href=""http://bit.ly/18PTzIY"">http://bit.ly/18PTzIY</a>), the NAPM issued a Request for Proposals and other bid documents (<a href=""http://bit.ly/1B7eUGS"">http://bit.ly/1B7eUGS</a>).</li><li>Between April 2013 and April 2014, the NAPM and the Commission’s Federal Advisory Committee, called the North American Numbering Council or NANC, conducted an extensive review of the bids, and each bidder was allowed to submit a “best and final offer” (<a href=""http://bit.ly/1wIhbK4"">http://bit.ly/1wIhbK4</a>).</li><li>In April 2014 the NANC submitted to the Commission its unanimous recommendation (<a href=""http://bit.ly/1Nh0H0u"">http://bit.ly/1Nh0H0u</a>) to select Telcordia as the next LNPA.</li><li>In June 2014, the Commission sought public comment (<a href=""http://bit.ly/1ENJh81"">http://bit.ly/1ENJh81</a>) on the NANC’s recommendation (<a href=""http://bit.ly/1Nh0H0u"">http://bit.ly/1Nh0H0u</a>), allowing more than two months (<a href=""http://bit.ly/1zKhGxV"">http://bit.ly/1zKhGxV</a>) for responses to give all parties time to evaluate the recommendation.&nbsp;</li><li>FCC staff independently reviewed and corroborated the NANC recommendation and analysis. Staff worked closely with law enforcement and national security experts outside of the FCC to ensure that security and reliability issues are addressed.&nbsp;</li><li>The draft order takes into account the NANC recommendation, input from many interested parties, and Telcordia’s experience administering sensitive numbering systems in the U.S. and abroad. The Commission will coordinate with other federal agencies and ensure that any final contract includes provisions to protect national security.&nbsp;</li></ul><b>Next Steps:</b>&nbsp;If the Commission adopts the draft order, the NAPM would begin to negotiate contract terms with Telcordia. These terms would be subject to approval by the FCC’s Wireline Competition Bureau. If a final contract is negotiated, then the Commission would oversee the transition to ensure that matters affecting the public interest, such as public safety and security, are fully addressed in the contract terms, and to ensure that any transition occurs efficiently and seamlessly.&nbsp;"
